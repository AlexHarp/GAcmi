    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;The Fractional Cover (FC) algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and is described in described in Scarth et al. (2010). It has been implemented by Geoscience Australia for every observation from Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat 7) and Operational Land Imager (Landsat 8) acquired since 1987. It is calculated from surface reflectance (SR-N_25_2.0.0). FC_25 provides a 25m scale fractional cover representation of the proportions of green or photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare surface cover across the Australian continent. The fractions are retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares unmixing model. For further information please see the articles below describing the method implemented which are free to read: - Scarth, P, Roder, A and Schmidt, M 2010, ‘Tracking grazing pressure and climate interaction – the role of Landsat fractional cover in time series analysis’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference, Schmidt, M, Denham, R and Scarth, P 2010, ‘Fractional ground cover monitoring of pastures and agricultural areas in Queensland’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference A summary of the algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Centre is also available from the AusCover website: &lt;a href="http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover"&gt;http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractio...&lt;/a&gt;. Fractional cover data can be used to identify large scale patterns and trends and inform evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind and water erosion risk, soil carbon dynamics, land management practices and rangeland condition. This information could enable policy agencies, natural and agricultural land resource managers, and scientists to monitor land conditions over large areas over long time frames.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>Nationally consistent information about fractional cover dynamics is essential to addressing a range of natural resource challenges. These include land management practices, air quality, soil erosion, rangeland condition and soil carbon dynamics. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort between The Department of Agriculture – ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional calibration data has enabled the calibration to extend to the entire Australian continent. FC_25 was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, the collaborative framework established by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments. The long term acquisition plan supported by the Landsat program, in combination with Geoscience Australia’s longstanding investment in the on-ground infrastructure required to capture Landsat imagery has made this product possible. Geoscience Australia’s partnership with the National Computing Infrastructure facilities in conjunction with the development of the Australian Geoscience Data Cube – a high performance data framework – makes it possible to analyse the continental archive of fractional cover data. FC_25 provides a consistent classification which will be an important foundation for land cover mapping and monitoring across Australia. It is a resource for natural resource managers, land surface process modellers, carbon modellers, rangeland managers, ecosystem scientists and policy makers.</Background>

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;The Fractional Cover (FC) algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and is described in described in Scarth et al. (2010). It has been implemented by Geoscience Australia for every observation from Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat 7) and Operational Land Imager (Landsat 8) acquired since 1987. It is calculated from surface reflectance (SR-N_25_2.0.0). FC_25 provides a 25m scale fractional cover representation of the proportions of green or photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare surface cover across the Australian continent. The fractions are retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares unmixing model. For further information please see the articles below describing the method implemented which are free to read: - Scarth, P, Roder, A and Schmidt, M 2010, ‘Tracking grazing pressure and climate interaction – the role of Landsat fractional cover in time series analysis’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference, Schmidt, M, Denham, R and Scarth, P 2010, ‘Fractional ground cover monitoring of pastures and agricultural areas in Queensland’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference A summary of the algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Centre is also available from the AusCover website: &lt;a href="http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover"&gt;http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractio...&lt;/a&gt;. Fractional cover data can be used to identify large scale patterns and trends and inform evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind and water erosion risk, soil carbon dynamics, land management practices and rangeland condition. This information could enable policy agencies, natural and agricultural land resource managers, and scientists to monitor land conditions over large areas over long time frames.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>Nationally consistent information about fractional cover dynamics is essential to addressing a range of natural resource challenges. These include land management practices, air quality, soil erosion, rangeland condition and soil carbon dynamics. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort between The Department of Agriculture – ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional calibration data has enabled the calibration to extend to the entire Australian continent. FC_25 was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, the collaborative framework established by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments. The long term acquisition plan supported by the Landsat program, in combination with Geoscience Australia’s longstanding investment in the on-ground infrastructure required to capture Landsat imagery has made this product possible. Geoscience Australia’s partnership with the National Computing Infrastructure facilities in conjunction with the development of the Australian Geoscience Data Cube – a high performance data framework – makes it possible to analyse the continental archive of fractional cover data. FC_25 provides a consistent classification which will be an important foundation for land cover mapping and monitoring across Australia. It is a resource for natural resource managers, land surface process modellers, carbon modellers, rangeland managers, ecosystem scientists and policy makers.</Background>

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;The Fractional Cover (FC) algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and is described in described in Scarth et al. (2010). It has been implemented by Geoscience Australia for every observation from Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat 7) and Operational Land Imager (Landsat 8) acquired since 1987. It is calculated from surface reflectance (SR-N_25_2.0.0). FC_25 provides a 25m scale fractional cover representation of the proportions of green or photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare surface cover across the Australian continent. The fractions are retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares unmixing model. For further information please see the articles below describing the method implemented which are free to read: - Scarth, P, Roder, A and Schmidt, M 2010, ‘Tracking grazing pressure and climate interaction – the role of Landsat fractional cover in time series analysis’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference, Schmidt, M, Denham, R and Scarth, P 2010, ‘Fractional ground cover monitoring of pastures and agricultural areas in Queensland’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference A summary of the algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Centre is also available from the AusCover website: &lt;a href="http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover"&gt;http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractio...&lt;/a&gt;. Fractional cover data can be used to identify large scale patterns and trends and inform evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind and water erosion risk, soil carbon dynamics, land management practices and rangeland condition. This information could enable policy agencies, natural and agricultural land resource managers, and scientists to monitor land conditions over large areas over long time frames.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>Nationally consistent information about fractional cover dynamics is essential to addressing a range of natural resource challenges. These include land management practices, air quality, soil erosion, rangeland condition and soil carbon dynamics. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort between The Department of Agriculture – ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional calibration data has enabled the calibration to extend to the entire Australian continent. FC_25 was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, the collaborative framework established by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments. The long term acquisition plan supported by the Landsat program, in combination with Geoscience Australia’s longstanding investment in the on-ground infrastructure required to capture Landsat imagery has made this product possible. Geoscience Australia’s partnership with the National Computing Infrastructure facilities in conjunction with the development of the Australian Geoscience Data Cube – a high performance data framework – makes it possible to analyse the continental archive of fractional cover data. FC_25 provides a consistent classification which will be an important foundation for land cover mapping and monitoring across Australia. It is a resource for natural resource managers, land surface process modellers, carbon modellers, rangeland managers, ecosystem scientists and policy makers.</Background>

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;The Fractional Cover (FC) algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and is described in described in Scarth et al. (2010). It has been implemented by Geoscience Australia for every observation from Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat 7) and Operational Land Imager (Landsat 8) acquired since 1987. It is calculated from surface reflectance (SR-N_25_2.0.0). FC_25 provides a 25m scale fractional cover representation of the proportions of green or photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare surface cover across the Australian continent. The fractions are retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares unmixing model. For further information please see the articles below describing the method implemented which are free to read: - Scarth, P, Roder, A and Schmidt, M 2010, ‘Tracking grazing pressure and climate interaction – the role of Landsat fractional cover in time series analysis’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference, Schmidt, M, Denham, R and Scarth, P 2010, ‘Fractional ground cover monitoring of pastures and agricultural areas in Queensland’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference A summary of the algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Centre is also available from the AusCover website: &lt;a href="http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover"&gt;http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractio...&lt;/a&gt;. Fractional cover data can be used to identify large scale patterns and trends and inform evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind and water erosion risk, soil carbon dynamics, land management practices and rangeland condition. This information could enable policy agencies, natural and agricultural land resource managers, and scientists to monitor land conditions over large areas over long time frames.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>Nationally consistent information about fractional cover dynamics is essential to addressing a range of natural resource challenges. These include land management practices, air quality, soil erosion, rangeland condition and soil carbon dynamics. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort between The Department of Agriculture – ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional calibration data has enabled the calibration to extend to the entire Australian continent. FC_25 was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, the collaborative framework established by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments. The long term acquisition plan supported by the Landsat program, in combination with Geoscience Australia’s longstanding investment in the on-ground infrastructure required to capture Landsat imagery has made this product possible. Geoscience Australia’s partnership with the National Computing Infrastructure facilities in conjunction with the development of the Australian Geoscience Data Cube – a high performance data framework – makes it possible to analyse the continental archive of fractional cover data. FC_25 provides a consistent classification which will be an important foundation for land cover mapping and monitoring across Australia. It is a resource for natural resource managers, land surface process modellers, carbon modellers, rangeland managers, ecosystem scientists and policy makers.</Background>

Fractional cover data can be used to identify large scale patterns and trends and inform evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind and water erosion risk, soil carbon dynamics, land management practices and rangeland condition. This information could enable policy agencies, natural and agricultural land resource managers, and scientists to monitor land conditions over large areas over long time frames.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>Nationally consistent information about fractional cover dynamics is essential to addressing a range of natural resource challenges. These include land management practices, air quality, soil erosion, rangeland condition and soil carbon dynamics. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort between The Department of Agriculture – ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional calibration data has enabled the calibration to extend to the entire Australian continent. FC_25 was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, the collaborative framework established by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments. The long term acquisition plan supported by the Landsat program, in combination with Geoscience Australia’s longstanding investment in the on-ground infrastructure required to capture Landsat imagery has made this product possible. Geoscience Australia’s partnership with the National Computing Infrastructure facilities in conjunction with the development of the Australian Geoscience Data Cube – a high performance data framework – makes it possible to analyse the continental archive of fractional cover data. FC_25 provides a consistent classification which will be an important foundation for land cover mapping and monitoring across Australia. It is a resource for natural resource managers, land surface process modellers, carbon modellers, rangeland managers, ecosystem scientists and policy makers.</Background>

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;The Fractional Cover (FC) algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and is described in described in Scarth et al. (2010). It has been implemented by Geoscience Australia for every observation from Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat 7) and Operational Land Imager (Landsat 8) acquired since 1987. It is calculated from surface reflectance (SR-N_25_2.0.0). FC_25 provides a 25m scale fractional cover representation of the proportions of green or photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare surface cover across the Australian continent. The fractions are retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares unmixing model. For further information please see the articles below describing the method implemented which are free to read: - Scarth, P, Roder, A and Schmidt, M 2010, ‘Tracking grazing pressure and climate interaction – the role of Landsat fractional cover in time series analysis’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference, Schmidt, M, Denham, R and Scarth, P 2010, ‘Fractional ground cover monitoring of pastures and agricultural areas in Queensland’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference A summary of the algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Centre is also available from the AusCover website: &lt;a href="http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover"&gt;http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractio...&lt;/a&gt;. Fractional cover data can be used to identify large scale patterns and trends and inform evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind and water erosion risk, soil carbon dynamics, land management practices and rangeland condition. This information could enable policy agencies, natural and agricultural land resource managers, and scientists to monitor land conditions over large areas over long time frames.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>Nationally consistent information about fractional cover dynamics is essential to addressing a range of natural resource challenges. These include land management practices, air quality, soil erosion, rangeland condition and soil carbon dynamics. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort between The Department of Agriculture – ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional calibration data has enabled the calibration to extend to the entire Australian continent. FC_25 was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, the collaborative framework established by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments. The long term acquisition plan supported by the Landsat program, in combination with Geoscience Australia’s longstanding investment in the on-ground infrastructure required to capture Landsat imagery has made this product possible. Geoscience Australia’s partnership with the National Computing Infrastructure facilities in conjunction with the development of the Australian Geoscience Data Cube – a high performance data framework – makes it possible to analyse the continental archive of fractional cover data. FC_25 provides a consistent classification which will be an important foundation for land cover mapping and monitoring across Australia.

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;The Fractional Cover (FC) algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and is described in described in Scarth et al. (2010). It has been implemented by Geoscience Australia for every observation from Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat 7) and Operational Land Imager (Landsat 8) acquired since 1987. It is calculated from surface reflectance (SR-N_25_2.0.0). FC_25 provides a 25m scale fractional cover representation of the proportions of green or photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare surface cover across the Australian continent. The fractions are retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares unmixing model. For further information please see the articles below describing the method implemented which are free to read: - Scarth, P, Roder, A and Schmidt, M 2010, ‘Tracking grazing pressure and climate interaction – the role of Landsat fractional cover in time series analysis’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference, Schmidt, M, Denham, R and Scarth, P 2010, ‘Fractional ground cover monitoring of pastures and agricultural areas in Queensland’, Proceedings of the 15th Australasian Remote Sensing &amp; Photogrammetry Conference A summary of the algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Centre is also available from the AusCover website: &lt;a href="http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover"&gt;http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractio...&lt;/a&gt;. Fractional cover data can be used to identify large scale patterns and trends and inform evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind and water erosion risk, soil carbon dynamics, land management practices and rangeland condition. This information could enable policy agencies, natural and agricultural land resource managers, and scientists to monitor land conditions over large areas over long time frames.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>Nationally consistent information about fractional cover dynamics is essential to addressing a range of natural resource challenges. These include land management practices, air quality, soil erosion, rangeland condition and soil carbon dynamics. The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort between The Department of Agriculture – ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional calibration data has enabled the calibration to extend to the entire Australian continent. FC_25 was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, the collaborative framework established by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments. The long term acquisition plan supported by the Landsat program, in combination with Geoscience Australia’s longstanding investment in the on-ground infrastructure required to capture Landsat imagery has made this product possible. Geoscience Australia’s partnership with the National Computing Infrastructure facilities in conjunction with the development of the Australian Geoscience Data Cube – a high performance data framework – makes it possible to analyse the continental archive of fractional cover data. FC_25 provides a consistent classification which will be an important foundation for land cover mapping and monitoring across Australia. It is a resource for natural resource managers, land surface process modellers, carbon modellers, rangeland managers, ecosystem scientists and policy makers.</Background>

    <Background>Europe’s Copernicus programme, and its constituent Sentinel constellation of satellites specifically, has been identified as a critical source of Earth observations from space data for Australia.
Recognising the importance of these satellites, Geoscience Australia, CSIRO, the Government of New South Wales, Government of Queensland and Government of Western Australia have formed a consortium to make data from Europe's Sentinel satellites easier to access and use for businesses, researchers, governments and the general public in the South-East Asia and South Pacific region.
On 4 November 2015, Australia and the European Union agreed to cooperate and to promote exploitation of data from the Sentinel satellites. A key element of this cooperation is around enhancing data access in the South East Asia-South Pacific region, with Australia agreeing to establish a Data Hub to support data access and exploitation in that region.
Geoscience Australia, representing consortium partners, is responsible for the download, maintenance and distribution to users of Sentinel-3 data at various levels of processing in South-East Asia/South Pacific through the regional data hub of Copernicus Australian Area of Interest. The National Computational Infrastructure in Canberra is the master repository of the data.</Background>

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;This resource contains multibeam sonar backscatter data for Outer Darwin Harbour collected by Geoscience Australia during the period from 28 May and 23 June 2015 on the RV Solander (survey SOL6187/GA0351). Partners involved in the survey included the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) and Department of Land Resource Management (Northern Territory Government). The survey was funded through the INPEX Offset Habitat Mapping Program for the Darwin Harbour region. The intent of this four year (2014-2018) program is to improve knowledge of the marine environments in the Darwin and Bynoe Harbour regions by collating and collecting baseline data that enable the creation of thematic habitat maps that underpin marine resource management decisions. The specific objectives of the survey were to: 1. Obtain high resolution geophysical (bathymetry) data for outer Darwin Harbour, including Shoal Bay; 2. Characterise substrates (acoustic backscatter properties, grainsize, sediment chemistry) for outer Darwin Harbour, including Shoal Bay; and 3. Collect tidal data for the survey area. Data acquired during the survey included: multibeam sonar bathymetry and acoustic backscatter; physical samples of seabed sediments, underwater photography and video of grab sample locations and oceanographic information including tidal data and sound velocity profiles. This dataset comprises multibeam backscatter data. A detailed account of the survey is provided in: Siwabessy, P.J.W., Smit, N., Atkinson, I., Dando, N., Harries, S., Howard, F.J.F., Li, J., Nicholas, W.A., Potter, A., Radke, L.C., Tran, M., Williams, D. and Whiteway, T., 2015.

    <Background>Europe’s Copernicus programme, and its constituent Sentinel constellation of satellites specifically, has been identified as a critical source of Earth observations from space data for Australia.
Recognising the importance of these satellites, Geoscience Australia, CSIRO, the Government of New South Wales, Government of Queensland and Government of Western Australia have formed a consortium to make data from Europe's Sentinel satellites easier to access and use for businesses, researchers, governments and the general public in the South-East Asia and South Pacific region.
On 4 November 2015, Australia and the European Union agreed to cooperate and to promote exploitation of data from the Sentinel satellites. A key element of this cooperation is around enhancing data access in the South East Asia-South Pacific region, with Australia agreeing to establish a Data Hub to support data access and exploitation in that region.
Geoscience Australia, representing consortium partners, is responsible for the download, maintenance and distribution to users of Sentinel-1 data at various levels of processing in South-East Asia/South Pacific through the regional data hub of Copernicus Australian Area of Interest. The National Computational Infrastructure in Canberra is the master repository of the data.</Background>

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;The PQ25 product facilitates interpretation and processing of Surface Reflectance (SR-N/NT),  Fractional Cover 25 (FC25) and all derivative products.&lt;br /&gt;
PQ25 is an assessment of each image pixel to determine if it is an unobscured, unsaturated observation of the Earth’s surface and also whether the pixel is represented in each spectral band. The PQ product allows users to produce masks which can be used to exclude pixels which don’t meet their quality criteria from analysis . The capacity to automatically exclude such pixels is essential for emerging multi-temporal analysis techniques that make use of every quality assured pixel within a time series of observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can choose to process only land pixels, or only sea pixels depending on their analytical requirements, leading to enhanced computationally efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>As Landsat Imagery becomes more readily available, there has been a rapid increase in the amount of analyses undertaken by researchers around the globe.  Most researchers use some form of quality masking schema in order to remove undesirable pixels from analysis, whether that be cloud, cloud shadow, observations over the ocean, or  saturated pixels.  In the past, researchers would reject partly cloud-affected scenes in favour of cloud-free scenes.  However, Landsat time series analysis using all cloud-free pixels has become a valuable technique and has increased the demand for automation of cloud, cloud shadow and saturation detection.  Emergency response applications such as flood mapping typically have to contend with individual cloud affected scenes and therefore rely on effective cloud and cloud shadow removal techniques. 
The PQ25 product combines established algorithms that detect clouds including the Automated Cloud Cover Assessment (ACCA) (Irish et al. 2006) and Function of mask (Fmask) (Zhu and Woodcock 2012) . ACCA is already widely used within the remote sensing community; it is fast and relatively accurate.  Fmask on the other hand is newer, but is rapidly becoming more established, and can provide a more accurate cloud mask than ACCA in certain cloud environments. 
The sensor saturation flagging protocols developed for the Web Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) product as described in Roy et al. (2011) are used to flag sensor saturation.
The PQ25 product has similarities to the QAB layer packaged with OLI data, however it uses additional algorithms to detect cloud and cloud shadow, and is available for Landsat’s 5, 7 and 8.</Background>

    <Background>The Intertidal Extents Model (ITEM v1.0) product analyses GA’s historic archive of satellite imagery to derive a model of the spatial extents of the intertidal zone throughout the tidal cycle. The model can assist in understanding the relative elevation profile of the intertidal zone, delineating exposed areas at differing tidal heights and stages.
The product differs from previous methods used to map the intertidal zone which have been predominately focused on analysing a small number of individual satellite images per location (e.g Ryu et al., 2002; Murray et al., 2012). By utilising a full 28 year time series of observations, the methodology enables us to overcome the requirement for clear, high quality observations acquired concurrent to the time of high and low tide. 
The modelling process to derive the product utilises a continental scale tidal model developed by Oregon State University (http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/tpxo8_atlas.html), applied to the 221 AGDC cells that cover the Australian coastline (Figure 1). 
Each Landsat tile in these coastal cells is attributed with a tidal offset, relative to Mean Sea Level (MSL), corresponding to the time of observation acquisition. Tidal offsets are modelled at a single constant location for each 1 degree by 1 degree cell, determined manually and based on the complexity of the coastline contained with the cell.
The time-series of observations for each AGDC cell is then sorted based on the modelled tidal offset, and split into subsets representing 10% percentile intervals of the observed tidal range (OTR) for that cell.  
Due the sun-synchronous nature of the various Landsat sensor observations; it is unlikely that the full physical extents of the tidal range in any cell will be observed. Hence, terminology has been adopted for the product to reflect the highest modelled tide observed in a given cell (HOT) and the lowest modelled tide observed (LOT) (Figure 2). These measures are relative to Mean Sea Level, and have no consistent relationship to Lowest (LAT) and Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT). 
Each tile observation is masked for pixel quality based on the AGDC PQA layer to exclude pixels flagged for cloud, band saturation and contiguity. The Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI)  (McFeeters, 1996) is calculated for each tile, and a pixel based median NDWI composite derived for each 10% percentile interval of the cell’s OTR.
The ten NDWI composites derived for each cell are used to estimate the extent of exposed substratum at each 10% interval of the OTR, and combined to create the Relative Extents Model.
The Confidence layer is designed to assess the reliability of the Relative Extent Model. Within each tidal range percentile interval, the pixel-based standard deviation of the NDWI values for all tiles in the interval subset is calculated. The average standard deviation across all tidal range intervals is then calculated and retained as a quality indicator in this product layer.
The Confidence Layer reflects the pixel based consistency of the NDWI values within each subset of observations, based on the tidal range. Higher standard deviation values indicate water classification changes not based on the tidal cycle, and hence lower confidence in the extent model. Possible drivers of these changes include:
1.	Inadequacies of the tidal model, due perhaps to complex coastal bathymetry or estuarine structures not captured in the model. 
2.	Change in the structure and exposure of water/non-water features NOT driven by tidal variation. For example, movement of sand banks in estuaries, construction of man-made features (ports etc.).
3.	Terrestrial/Inland water features not influenced by the tidal cycle.
Note: The confidence layer should be utilised on a cell-by-cell basis.  Standard deviation values within the confidence layer for a particular cell are not comparable to other cells within the model.</Background>

&lt;p&gt;The product will utilise tidal offset values relative to MSL, calculated for each coastal tile observation at time of acquisition, using the Oregon State Tidal Prediction (OTPS) software TPX08 Atlas model (&lt;a href="http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/tpxo8_atlas.html"&gt;http://volkov.oce.orst.edu/tides/tpxo8_atlas.html&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observations per coastal cell will then be sorted by tidal offset to obtain tiles corresponding to the lowest 10% of tides observed in the archive. A band based median for each Landsat band will then be calculated from the lowest 10% subset of tiles for each cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI data will be used for this product, as inclusion of Landsat 7 leaves a large number of data artefacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product will be calculated for the epoch 1995-2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observations will be filtered to remove poor quality observations including cloud, cloud shadow, band saturation (of any band).&lt;/p&gt;

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;ARG-Index-Stats provides time interval statistics of normalised difference indexes derived from surface reflectance measurements for epochs within an overall analysis period where:&lt;br /&gt;
-	Overall analysis period is defined as the period of years for which the time interval statistics per epoch are calculated. Overall analysis period is provided by the user and must fall within the temporal bounds of the ARG dataset. Usually the overall analysis period is the total available within the ARG dataset (1987 to present).&lt;br /&gt;
-	Epoch is defined as a recurring length of time (usually a number of years) within the overall analysis period. Epoch lengths to be provided by the user. Examples of epochs are 5 or 10 year periods, or specific intervals such as might encompass a drought or wet period.&lt;br /&gt;
-	Time interval is defined as consistent and recurring start and end points within each epoch within the overall analysis period. Time interval start and end points to be provided by the user.&lt;br /&gt;
Statistics are drawn from the spectral index for the time interval, calculated over each epoch, for the full period of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nominal settings&lt;br /&gt;
Time period statistics may be chosen from:&lt;br /&gt;
•	Minimum&lt;br /&gt;
•	Nth  percentile(s)&lt;br /&gt;
•	Standard deviation&lt;br /&gt;
•	Mean&lt;br /&gt;
•	Maximum&lt;br /&gt;
•	Count of clear observations&lt;br /&gt;
Statistics are derived from individual observations of normalised difference indexes derived from ARG data. Statistics may be delivered as the nearest, non-interpolated value of the dataset value (i.e., an actual pixel value from the available data, which may vary from the calculated percentile value) or as interpolated values depending on user specification.&lt;br /&gt;
Spectral indexes may be any 2-band normalised difference index applicable to ARG data.&lt;br /&gt;
Observations will be filtered to remove poor quality observations including cloud, cloud shadow, band saturation (of any band). Water may be filtered if specified by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;The Pixel Quality (PQ) product is a classification that represents an assessment of whether an image pixel represents an un-obscured unsaturated observation  of the Earth’s surface and whether the pixel is represented in each spectral band. The PQ product allows users to produce masks which can be used to exclude  affected pixels from which don’t meet their quality criteria from further analysis. The capacity to automatically exclude such pixels from analysis is essential for emerging multi-temporal analysis techniques that make use of every quality assured pixel within a time series of observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PQ-STATS show the number of times a particular pixel quality flag or bit occurs for each pixel. The products show the breakdown of how many times a pixel has been masked out based on various pixel quality measures for each sensor and each year. The products are counts and are additive. This allows a range of questions to be asked of the data. i.e. how many times have the various cloud shadow masks been applied to data in a particular location, and does this vary with sensor over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>PQ provides  an assessment of the quality of observations at a pixel level and  contains information about whether a pixel is affected by:
•	Spectral Contiguity (lack of signal in any band)
•	Saturation in any band
•	Presence of cloud
•	Presence of cloud shadow
•	Being offshore (sea)
The series of 0’s &amp; 1’s in the PQ filename indicate which of the 16 tests (See B.2b below for more information)  have been run. Eg. LS5_TM_PQ_P55_GAPQ01-002_089_083_20081209_1111111111111100.tif whereas a LS8 OLI only file is given as LS8_OLI_PQ_P55_GAPQ01-002_099_080_20130707_1111100111000000.tif 
Users can choose to process only land pixels, or only sea pixels depending on their analytical requirements.  This makes analysis of coastal locations more rapid and more computationally efficient.
The different sensor designs of Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI all have different sensor saturation characteristics.  The PQ25 layer enables users to exclude observations from a given band where the pixels are saturated (exceed the dynamic range of the sensor).  The per-band saturation information in PQ  allows users to exclude pixels where their specific band of interest is saturated.
The PQ 25 layer uses two industry standard cloud/cloud shadow detection algorithms to flag pixels that potentially contain cloud and allows the user to generate masks based on either algorithm or both algorithms.
The PQ25-STATS product produces an annual summary of the number of times a particular flag has been triggered. This provides a platform for analysising where particular pixel quality indicators most often occur, and allows analysis of areas of omission and commission.</Background>

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;The ‘seasonal’ statistics of surface reflectance measurements, where:&lt;br /&gt;
-	season is defined as consistent start and end points for 4 nominal seasons each year with arbitrary season dates to be provided by the user.&lt;br /&gt;
The nominated standard season dates are:&lt;br /&gt;
The summer season will extend from 17th Nov to 25th April&lt;br /&gt;
The spring season will extend from 17th August to the 25th January&lt;br /&gt;
The Autumn season will extend from 16th February to 25th July&lt;br /&gt;
The Winter Season will extend from 17th May to 25th October&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-	epoch is defined as the period of years for which the seasonal statistics are calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics are drawn from the reflectance values for the season, calculated over each epoch, for the full period of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nominal settings&lt;br /&gt;
Statistics returned: the 25th , 50th (median)  and 75th  percentiles of surface reflectance, delivered as the nearest, non-interpolated value of the dataset to the calculated percentile value (i.e., an actual pixel value from the available data, which may vary from the calculated percentile value)&lt;br /&gt;
Season (UTC) : standard calendar year seasons&lt;br /&gt;
Epochs: 1985-1989,1990-1994, etc. … 2014&lt;br /&gt;
(noting that the choice of season dates may cross into the next calendar year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observations will be filtered to remove poor quality observations including cloud, cloud shadow, band saturation (of any band). Sea is not filtered. Water is not filtered.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>Moderate resolution earth observation satellites acquire data over Australia on a daily basis.  However the frequency with with which a particular location is observed depends on a range of factors including satellite overpass, cloud and cloud shadows.  This product is a rolling composite of data that is updated on a weekly basis and shows the most up-to-date observation for every pixel.  The product consists of three components, the surface reflectance data, the date of observation and the satellite that acquired that observation.</Background>

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;Live green plants absorb solar radiation in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectral region, which they use as a source of energy in the process of photosynthesis. Leaf cells have also evolved to reflect, scatter and re-emit solar radiation in the near-infrared spectral region. The pigment in plant leaves, chlorophyll, strongly absorbs visible light (from 0.4 to 0.7 µm) for use in photosynthesis. The cell structure of the leaves, on the other hand, strongly reflects near-infrared light (from 0.7 to 1.1 µm). Hence, live green plants appear relatively dark in the PAR and relatively bright in the near-infrared.&lt;br /&gt;
By contrast, clouds and snow tend to be rather bright in the red (as well as other visible wavelengths) and quite dark in the near-infrared.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index  (NDVI) is calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(NIR-RED)/(NIR+RED)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where RED and NIR stand for the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the red and near-infrared regions, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>First described in Tucker (1979) the NDVI has been widely used as a vegetation index to characterise the amount of vegetation on the Earths surface. The study by Carlson and Ripley (1997) is widely cited and describes the relationship between NDVI, fractional vegetation cover and leaf area index.</Background>

    <Background>Landsat Archive
GA has acquired Landsat imagery over Australia since 1979, including  TM, ETM+ and OLI imagery. While this data has been used extensively for numerous land and coastal mapping studies, its utility for accurate monitoring of environmental resources has been limited by the processing methods that have been traditionally used to correct for inherent geometric and radiometric distortions in EO imagery. To improve access to Australia’s archive of Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI data, several collaborative projects have been undertaken in conjunction with industry, government and academic partners. These projects have enabled implementation of a more integrated approach to image data correction that incorporates normalising models to account for atmospheric effects, BRDF and topographic shading (Li et al., 2012). The approach has been applied to Landsat TM/ETM+ and OLI imagery to create the SR products. The advanced supercomputing facilities provided by the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) at the Australian National University (ANU) have been instrumental in handling the considerable data volumes and processing complexities involved with production of this product.
Surface Reflectance Correction Models
Image radiance values recorded by passive EO sensors are a composite of:
• surface reflectance;
• atmospheric condition;
• interaction between surface land cover, solar radiation and sensor view angle; and
• land surface orientation relative to the imaging sensor.
It has been traditionally assumed that Landsat imagery display negligible variation in sun and sensor view angles, however these can vary significantly both within and between scenes, especially in different seasons and geographic regions (Li et al., 2012). The SR product delivers modeled surface reflectance from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI/ data using physical rather than empirical models. Accordingly, this product will ensure that reflective value differences between imagery acquired at different times by different sensors will be primarily due to on-ground changes in biophysical parameters rather than artifacts of the imaging environment.
Integrated Time Series Data
Once consistent and comparable measures of surface reflectance have been retrieved from EO data, it is possible to quantify changes in Earth surface features through time.
Given the growing time series of EO imagery, this landmark facility will streamline the process of reliably monitoring long-term changes in land and water resources.</Background>

    <Background>The Australian Geographic Reference Image (AGRI) is a consistent and accurate reference image for rectification of imagery from multiple sources at resolutions of 2.5 metres or less. The AGRI is needed because the emerging new satellites and other sources of imagery will generate increasing amounts of data. The AGRI can ensure that images from these sources are consistently and accurately registered to allow the maximum extraction of information.
During compilation more than 9560 satellite scenes, totalling over 6 terabytes, were used to produce eight mosaics, covering each of Australia's Universal Transverse Mercator map zones. These mosaics were then combined to produce a single mosaic covering the Australian continent. Intensity and contrast balancing were used to ensure visual consistency across the mosaic while maintaining the dynamic range of the image.
The AGRI was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, international collaboration, the Australian spatial information industry, and the leadership and capabilities of Geoscience Australia. Japan's Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) made possible the complete coverage of high quality imagery, which forms the foundation of the AGRI, as well as accurate data on the satellite orbit. Geoscience Australia was an international collaborator on the ALOS; handling data for the Oceania region. The Barista software, developed by the Cooperative Research Centre for Spatial Information, made the project feasible in terms of time, logistics, and cost. Barista reduced the image registration problem from correction of almost 10 000 scenes to correction of just 105 orbit segments (Lewis et al, 2011).
The expertise and capability of the Australian spatial information industry was used in the design of GIS databases to manage the survey data and to conduct the many field surveys to remote areas of Australia. The expertise and capabilities of Geoscience Australia staff in both Earth observation and geodesy were also essential inputs to the project (Lewis et al, 2011).
The AGRI provides a consistent base image which will be an important foundation for future mapping and monitoring across Australia. It is a resource for both users and providers of satellite imagery covering Australia in government agencies, research institutions and academia, the spatial information industry, and international satellite operators. The AGRI mosaic and associated datasets are available to the public under the Creative Commons-Attribution licensing terms at cost of transfer from Geoscience Australia.</Background>

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;The Fractional Cover (FC) algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program and is described in described in Scarth et al. (2010). It has been implemented by Geoscience Australia  for every observation from Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat 5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (Landsat 7) and Operational Land Imager (Landsat 8) acquired since 1987. It is calculated from surface reflectance (SR-N_25_2.0.0). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FC_25 provides a 25m scale fractional cover representation of the proportions of green or photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare surface cover across the Australian continent. The fractions are retrieved by inverting multiple linear regression estimates and using synthetic endmembers in a constrained non-negative least squares unmixing model. For further information please see the articles below describing the method implemented which are free to read: - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A summary of the algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Centre is also available from the AusCover website: &lt;a href="http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractional+Cover"&gt;http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Fractio...&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fractional cover data  can be used to identify large scale patterns and trends and inform evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind and water erosion risk, soil carbon dynamics, land management practices and rangeland condition. This information could enable policy agencies, natural and agricultural land resource managers, and scientists to monitor land conditions over large areas over long time frames.&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>Nationally consistent information about fractional cover dynamics is essential to addressing a range of natural resource challenges. These include land management practices, air quality, soil erosion, rangeland condition and soil carbon dynamics.
The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program (JRSRP) and is described in Scarth et al. (2010). While originally calibrated in Queensland, a large collaborative effort between The Department of Agriculture – ABARES and State and Territory governments to collect additional calibration data has enabled the calibration to extend to the entire Australian continent.
FC_25 was made possible by new scientific and technical capabilities, the collaborative framework established by the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS), and collaborative effort between state and Commonwealth governments. 
The long term acquisition plan supported by the Landsat program, in combination with Geoscience Australia’s longstanding investment in the on-ground infrastructure required to capture Landsat imagery has made this product possible.  Geoscience Australia’s partnership with the National Computing Infrastructure facilities in conjunction with the development of the Australian Geoscience Data Cube – a high performance data framework – makes it possible to analyse the continental archive of fractional cover data.
FC_25 provides a consistent classification which will be an important foundation for land cover mapping and monitoring across Australia. It is a resource for natural resource managers, land surface process modellers, carbon modellers, rangeland managers, ecosystem scientists and policy makers.</Background>

    <Background>The Water Observations from Space product (WO_25_2.0) is a key component of the National Flood Risk Information Portal (NFRIP), being developed by Geoscience Australia (GA). The objective of Water Observations from Space is to analyse GA’s historic archive of satellite imagery to derive water observations, to help understand where flooding may have occurred in the past.
WO_25_2.0 is being developed in parallel with the National Flood Studies Database system which will provide Flood Study documentation and reports to a wide range of users. Both systems will be delivered via the internet through the NFRIP portal.
Satellite imagery has been used to map floods around the world for several years. Organisations such as the Colorado Flood Observatory in the USA and several state-based agencies in Australia regularly provide satellite-based flood extents for major flood events. GA developed a flood mapping methodology in 2008-2009 that was extensively used for the major Australian flood events since 2010, providing emergency service agencies with regional flood extent information.
The Phase 1 outputs from the NFRIP were delivered to the public in November 2012, including a proof of concept of WO_25_2.0. This displayed surface water extents for three study areas, including the original derived extents and the cumulative summary product. Subsequent stakeholder feedback has shown that the most desirable information is the summary product, providing an understanding of the long term dynamics of surface water.
The Phase 2 outputs from the NFRIP (released in April 2014), include this WO_25_2.0 product, which is now accessible to the public as web services, online viewers and the underlying data .
Confidence Level
Reviews of prototype products identified the need to indicate the level of confidence for the surface water observations. The confidence level will help the user to distinguish between unusual but valid water detections (such as flood plains which might only be observed as water once in the 15 year interval) and ‘false positives’ which can be caused, for instance, by steep shady slopes.
The confidence level was determined through a multiple logistic regression of water observations against several factors that would either support or contra-indicate the finding of water being present at the site.
The factors comprise:
MrVBF, a multi-resolution valley bottom flatness product (Gallant et al., 2012) derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) as part of the Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Network. Surface water pixels identified in valley bottoms were more likely to be positively detected.
Slope calculated from SRTM Digital Surface Models. Water pixels on a slope were considered less plausible than those on a flat surface.
MODIS Open Water Likelihood (OWL) (Ticehurst et al, 2010) provides a plausibility based an independent water detection algorithm employing the MODIS sensor. If both detection algorithms agree on the presence of a surface water pixel, there is a greater plausibility that the detection is correct.
Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) is a GIS of hydrological features derived from manually interpreted topographic map grids. If known hydrologic features (pixels) from GeoFabric coincide with detected water pixels, the plausibility of detection is greater.
P, the number of observations of water as a fraction of the number of clear observations of the target pixel. P is high for more permanent water bodies.
Built-Up areas indicating areas of dense urban development. In such areas the water detection algorithm struggles to cope with the deep shadows cast by multi-story buildings and the generally noisy spectral response created by structures. The Built-Up layer is derived from the Australian Bureau of Statistics ASGS 2011 dataset, for urban centres of populations of 100 000 and over.</Background>

    <Overview>&lt;p&gt;The Dynamic Land Cover Dataset Version 2 is a suite of land cover information products from Geoscience Australia (GA). These standard information products deliver International Standards Organisation (ISO) compliant land cover maps across the Australian landmass. The datasets provide a consistent series of maps that show how Australian land cover is changing over time.&lt;br /&gt;
The first product in this suite, DLCDv1, was published in 2011 and was based on 250 metre resolution MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data acquired between April 2000 and April 2008.&lt;br /&gt;
The product described in this document, DLCDv2, consists of a series of 11 maps each based on 2 years of MODIS data. The 11 maps cover the period between January 2002 – December 2013.&lt;br /&gt;
The DLCDv2 is the second DLCD product released by GA. It is based on the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) product MOD13Q1. For details see:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_products_table/mod13q1"&gt;https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_products_table/mod13q1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each map has been generated by applying a  sophisticated time series analysis technique known as Dynamic Markov Chain modelling to two years of MODIS EVI data.  The outputs of the time series analysis are filtered using a class change constraint matrix, a terrain mask and MODIS  green albedo products. The maps contain 22 land cover classes as outlined below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <Background>The MOD13Q1 data set is one of the standard MODIS products available through the Land Process Distributed Active Archive Centre (LPDAAC).  Details are at: https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/modis_products_table/mod13q1
The MOD13Q1 represents two vegetation indices, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) calculated from data captured by the MODIS sensor on the TERRA satellite.  The MOD13Q1 product is produced as tiles according to the sinusoidal tile grid system. For details see:http://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_grid.html
The archive of MODIS land data products have been collected by CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research and reprojected using the MODIS reprojection tool (MRT) at:https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/modis_reprojection_tool
The reprojected data that cover Australia have been mosaicked and are available online at the National Computing Infrastructure on a one-file-per-time-interval basis, from:https://remote-sensing.nci.org.au/u39/public/html/modis/lpdaac-mosaics-c...
Reformatting
The MOD13Q1 data for each 16-day interval were concatenated into a data cube to enable retrieval of a time series of EVI values for an individual 250m x 250m pixel.
Pre-processing
The EVI data contain occasional spikes and dips that do not represent biophysical changes and are not captured by the data quality flags.  These anomalous points were removed using the spike removal algorithm outlined in Lymburner et al. (2011).
Time series analysis
The EVI data cube was analysed using a number of state-of-the-art time series analysis techniques to classify the time series signal observed over a two-year period into a specific class.  The inputs and algorithm workflow used to generate DLCDv2 are outlined in Figure 1.  The inputs and algorithm workflow are described in detail in Tan et al. in preparation.</Background>
